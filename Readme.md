## Object Oriented Programming

### Introduction:

Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a widely used paradigm in software development that allows for modular and organized code. JavaScript, a versatile and powerful programming language, also supports OOPs concepts.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is essentially a programming paradigm that organises code into reusable, self-contained objects. It focuses on the concept of objects, which represent real-world entities with their own attributes (data) and behaviours (methods).

OOP allows developers to write modular, maintainable, and scalable code by promoting code reusability and encapsulation. OOP Concepts in JavaScript can be defined as the concepts that promote Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.
